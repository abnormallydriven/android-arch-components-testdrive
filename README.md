# android-arch-components-testdrive

A sample app that exercises the new Android architecture components. It makes use of
both Lifecycle and Room. The app's "functionality" simply allows for the creation of
 "users" and "measurements" like weight or waist size for those users on a given date.
 I wrote it to get some experience with using the new libraries. I have also written
 a small blog post about both libraries here:
